EXPLAIN ANALYZE not only shows the execution plan (which tables are scanned, what indexes are used, and join methods), but also gives you the actual time taken for each step. For example, when
running a query on the partitioned bookings table for 2023, EXPLAIN ANALYZE will show that only the p2023 partition is scanned, and you’ll see reduced execution time compared to the unpartitioned version.


SHOW PROFILE breaks down query execution into stages like "parsing," "opening tables," "executing," and "sending data," along with the time each stage takes. This helps pinpoint where
most of the time is spent. For instance, if most time is in “sending data,” it means too many rows are being returned; if it’s in “executing,” it may indicate missing indexes or inefficient joins.
